# about
i program, mainly in C and Lua

i'm making my own hobby programming language called TriniC.
it's an explicitly and statically typed low-level programming language. using
it is meant to feel somewhat like using C, but has improved macros and safety
features


<br>
in addition to programming languages, i also like "actual"\* languages, and
linguistics as a whole

i've been involved in the creation of constructed languages, often called
"conlangs" off-and-on since middle school. my current conlang is a fluid-S
active-stative polysynthetic conlang primarily inspired by Yup'ik, Saanich, and
Navajo.

unfortunately, resources on polysynthetic languages are generally limited to
journals locked behind paywalls, or 500+ page grammar documentation on a
specific language, which makes it incredibly hard to get a good idea of what
polysynthesis looks like across many languages in any reasonable amount of time.
as i'll have to wade through grammars of multiple languages myself, i figured
that i would at least make it easier for people who come <i>after</i> me by
sharing my findings in in-depth yet easy-to-read posts on specific features,
using multiple languages as reference.

# footnote
\* programming languages exhibit many features that so-called "real" languages
do, despite appearing radically different, and thus should be considered just
as "real" as languages like English or Japanese
