# about

i'm jans heikkinen and i'm a programming and linguistics enthusiast. i may be
referred to with whichever pronouns you find most fitting.

my main area of interest in programming is in programming language development.
i'm currently developing a language called trinic a compiled low-level language
which i plan to use in my other area of interest: os development.

when it comes to linguistics, i'm predominantly involved in the creation of
conlangs. expect many blog posts to be conlanger-oriented and generally about
polysynthesis specifically.

everything of my own making on this site is in the public domain. use it however
you see fit, with or without credit. please message me if anything on this site
is incorrect.
